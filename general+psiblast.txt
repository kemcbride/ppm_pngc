## Notes on using psiblast

- Basic usage
psiblast -db [database] -query [input fasta query file path]

- The default database is nr, so you don't need to include that option
if you are making a query against nr.
- Thus, a default query would be like:

psiblast -query [input file]

or 

psiblast -query ~/Downloads/Ari_PngC.fasta


- However, that will only output the results into your terminal. If you want
to save your results, you've got to make the output (on stdout) go into a file.
You can do this in 2 ways. (Well, you can probably do it in an infinite number of ways, but basically, 2)

- You can either pipe directly to stdout, but you won't get any output in your terminal:

psiblast [options] > [output file path]

- Or, you can use the command/program "tee" which will print your output into your terminal
as well as save it into a file:

psiblast [options] | tee [output file path]


- Remember! If you want to see the "help" for a command, there are kinda two ways.

man [command/program name] is the standard linux/unix way. 

[command/program name] --help
[command/program name] -help

- That's the other way, which is more specific to the command. Psiblast only supports -help.

- Remember also, that when you generally call for help using --help or -help or man,
they will just go straight to your terminal and you won't be able to scroll through.

So really, you'll want to do:

[command/program name] --help | less

So that you can scroll through it and read it as you like.
